## Project Overview

 This Notebook was part of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree. In this project, I learned to develop a network, that, given an image of a dog, would identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  

## Steps to Completion
 
 1. Investigation of cascades and facial recognition.
 2. Use a pre-trained CNN to identify dogs.
 3. Attempt to classify dogs using a CNN from scratch.
 4. Modify a pre-trained CNN classifier section in order to classify the 133 breeds of dogs provided.
 
 Note: all data images for training and validation and model files are stored locally.
